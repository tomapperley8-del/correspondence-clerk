-- Stage 18, "keeping it running" (Decision 29 Oct, gap 1): the system alarm.
-- On 26-27 Oct the three Claude routines didn't run (the weekly usage limit) and nobody noticed:
-- check_routine_heartbeats() opened tasks, but those are hidden in the app and the desk email only
-- mentioned them at the bottom. system_alarm() lists every scheduled job and routine with its last
-- good run, when it was last due, and whether it missed. The desk email starts with a "System" line
-- and Today shows a banner only when something missed.
--
-- Jobs, each judged on UTC days (pg_cron and Vercel run on UTC):
--   pg_cron: every active job in cron.job (schedule "M H * * D"), good = a succeeded run in
--            cron.job_run_details, due 30 minutes after its start time.
--   Vercel:  desk email (routine_heartbeat 'desk_email', due 09:00), Club Card read
--            (club_card_sync_runs ok, daily 02:30, due 03:30), newsletter read (newsletter_read_runs ok,
--            Wednesday 12:00, due 13:00), Companies House read (scraper_logs with source
--            'Companies House' and no errors, Monday 05:30, due 06:30). The cleanup crons keep no record.
--   Routines: routine_schedule (enabled), good = a routine_heartbeat that day, due 10:30 (the time
--            check_routine_heartbeats looks). Their iso_days say weekdays, so a weekend is never a miss.
-- Each time a job was due is judged on its own: good if a good run happened that UTC day (or later,
-- before it was next due). Shown: misses in the last 30 hours, and while the latest is unmet, the
-- whole run of misses back to the last good run.
-- p_now lets a check replay a past morning (supabase/tests/stage18_system_alarm_test.sql).
-- Security definer because cron.* is not readable by signed-in users; returns job names and
-- times only. Grants: authenticated, service_role. Rollback: rollback/20261030_002_system_alarm_rollback.sql
