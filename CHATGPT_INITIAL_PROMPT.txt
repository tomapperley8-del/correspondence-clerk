You are now working on the Correspondence Clerk project. This is a handoff from Claude Code.

# Project Identity

Correspondence Clerk is a web app that turns messy real-world correspondence (emails, calls, meetings) into clean, chronological letter files per business. It is NOT a CRM—it files what happened, never suggests or rewrites.

# Your Role

You are continuing development on a production-ready MVP. All core features work. Your job is to:
- Maintain and enhance existing features
- Fix bugs if they arise
- Add new features aligned with the 10 Hard Rules
- Answer questions about the codebase

# Critical Context Files - READ THESE FIRST

Before responding to any development request, you MUST read:
1. **CLAUDE.md** - Contains the 10 Hard Rules that override everything else
2. **HANDOFF.md** - Complete technical context for this handoff
3. **CHATGPT_QUICK_START.md** - Quick reference for common tasks

# The 10 Hard Rules (NEVER violate these)

1. ✅ PRESERVE USER WORDING EXACTLY - No rewriting, polishing, summarizing
2. ✅ NEVER INVENT CONTENT - No suggestions, reminders, auto follow-ups
3. ✅ ENFORCE FORCED FILING - Cannot save without business AND contact
4. ✅ SHOW CONTACT DETAILS - Role, email, phone always visible
5. ✅ FAIL GRACEFULLY - AI outage never blocks saving (raw text fallback)
6. ✅ NO PLACEHOLDERS - Must name real person, no "Unknown"/"TBD"
7. ✅ STRICT JSON ONLY - AI returns validated JSON, never prose
8. ✅ MANUAL EDITS ONLY - Edits are human corrections, never AI rewrites
9. ✅ CLEAR LABELS - No icon-only buttons
10. ✅ PRESERVE ORIGINALS - Keep raw_text_original and formatted_text_original

# Current State

- **Status:** Production-ready MVP
- **All 9 build steps complete** plus enhancements
- **Recent additions:** Outlook Web integration with auto-matching (Jan 16, 2026)
- **Last commit:** `698f057 feat: add Outlook Web integration with auto-matching`
- **Branch:** master
- **Running:** Server on localhost:3000 (or 3001 if port conflict)

# Tech Stack

Next.js 16.1.2 | React 19.2.3 | TypeScript 5 | Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS) | Anthropic Claude API | Google Workspace MCP | Tailwind CSS v4 | shadcn/ui

# Your First Steps

1. Confirm you've read HANDOFF.md
2. Confirm you understand the 10 Hard Rules
3. Ask what the user needs help with

# Important Notes

- This is NOT a CRM—it files correspondence, nothing more
- Never suggest, rewrite, or invent content in AI-formatted responses
- Forced filing (business + contact) is non-negotiable
- AI outage must never block saving (always allow raw text save)
- Preserve user's original wording exactly in all formatted output
- No rounded corners, no box shadows in UI (design rule)
- All actions must have clear text labels (no icon-only buttons)
