## Getting Started

### What is Correspondence Clerk?

Correspondence Clerk is your digital filing system for business correspondence. Think of it as replacing those Word documents where you used to copy and paste emails and call notes. Instead of manually maintaining letter files for each business, Correspondence Clerk does it automatically.

**What it does:**
- Files emails, calls, and meeting notes in one place
- Organizes everything by business, in chronological order
- Makes past correspondence instantly searchable
- Generates print-ready documents when you need them
- Helps teams share visibility into business relationships

**What it doesn't do:**
- It's not a CRM - no sales pipeline or deal tracking
- It doesn't suggest next steps or auto-follow-ups
- It doesn't rewrite your words - it preserves your voice exactly

### Quick Overview (5-Minute Tour)

1. **Dashboard** - See all your businesses at a glance, sorted by what needs attention
2. **New Entry** - Paste an email or type call notes, select the business and person
3. **Business Letter File** - View the complete correspondence history for any business
4. **Search** - Find past conversations by keyword or business name
5. **Export** - Generate a Google Doc with all correspondence for a business

### How to Log In

1. Open your browser and go to your Correspondence Clerk URL (provided by your administrator)
2. Enter your email address and password
3. If you're a new team member, use the invitation link sent to your email

**First time logging in?**
- You'll be asked to create an organization (if you're the first user)
- Or you'll join an existing organization (if you were invited)

### First-Time Setup

**If you're starting fresh:**
1. Log in and create your organization
2. Import your business list (optional - you can also add them as you go)
3. Start filing correspondence

**If you're joining a team:**
1. Accept your invitation via email
2. You'll immediately see all businesses and correspondence your team has filed
3. Start adding new entries right away

## Core Features

### Dashboard Overview

The Dashboard is your home base. It answers one question: **What needs doing?**

**How it's sorted:**
1. **Action needed** - businesses with follow-ups, invoices, or renewals
2. **Overdue** - entries with past-due dates
3. **Least recently contacted** - businesses you haven't touched in a while

**Each business card shows:**
- Business name
- Category (e.g., Club Card, Advertiser)
- Status flags
- Last contacted date
- Action needed badge (if any)
- Overdue badge (if any)

**Filtering options:**
- All businesses
- Club Card only
- Advertiser only
- Action needed only

**Quick actions:**
- Click any card to view the full letter file
- Search bar at the top to find a business by name

### Creating a New Entry

This is how you file correspondence - whether it's an email, phone call, or meeting notes.

**Step 1: Paste or type your content**

In the large text area, you can:
- Paste an entire email (including headers and thread history)
- Type notes from a phone call
- Copy meeting notes

**Step 2: Select the business**

Start typing the business name and select from the dropdown. If the business doesn't exist:
- Click "Add New Business"
- Enter the name and optional details
- Save and continue

**Step 3: Select the contact**

Choose the person you corresponded with. The dropdown shows:
- Contact name
- Role (if recorded)
- Email address (if recorded)

If the person doesn't exist:
- Click "Add New Contact"
- Enter their name (required)
- Add their role, email, phone (optional but recommended)

**Why you must name a contact:**
This ensures your letter file is always clear about who you spoke with. No "Unknown" placeholders allowed.

**Step 4: Set optional fields**

- **Entry type** - Email, Call, or Meeting (auto-detected from pasted content)
- **Action needed** - Mark if follow-up is required (none, prospect, follow-up, etc.)
- **Due date** - Set a reminder date for follow-ups

**Step 5: Save**

Click "Save Entry" and you're done. The entry is filed, the business letter file is updated, and the dashboard reflects the new activity.

**What happens when you save:**
1. Your original text is preserved exactly as entered
2. AI improves the layout and spacing (if available)
3. The entry appears in the business letter file
4. Business "last contacted" date is updated
5. You're taken to the business page to see the saved entry

**If AI formatting fails:**
Don't worry - your entry saves anyway as "unformatted". You can format it later when the AI service is back online.

### Understanding Email Thread Splitting

When you paste an email chain (multiple back-and-forth emails), Correspondence Clerk can detect it and offer to split it into individual entries.

**How it works:**
1. Paste an email thread
2. If detected, you'll see a toggle: "Split into individual emails"
3. Toggle ON to split, OFF to keep as one entry
4. Preview shows how many entries will be created
5. Confirm and save

**When to split:**
- Long email threads with multiple back-and-forth messages
- When you want each email dated separately in the letter file

**When not to split:**
- Single email with quoted history at the bottom
- Call notes or meeting notes (not applicable)
- Short exchanges where one entry is clearer

**What gets split:**
- Each distinct email in the thread
- In chronological order (oldest first)
- Each gets its own date, sender, subject

**What doesn't get split:**
- AI doesn't invent missing emails
- Incomplete threads stay intact
- If uncertain, splitting is turned OFF by default

### Searching for Past Correspondence

Find anything you've filed, fast.

**Search by business name:**
- Type in the search bar
- Results prioritize business name matches
- Click any result to view that business's letter file

**Search by keyword:**
- Type any word or phrase from past correspondence
- Results show matching entries across all businesses
- Highlights show where your search term appears

**Search tips:**
- Use specific terms (e.g., "contract renewal" not "contract")
- Business names always rank higher than keyword matches
- Search is case-insensitive
- Searches across both original and formatted text

**Results show:**
- Business name
- Entry date and type
- Contact name
- Snippet with your search term highlighted
- Quick link to view the full entry

### Exporting to Google Docs

Create a print-ready Google Doc with all correspondence for a business.

**How to export:**
1. Open any business letter file
2. Click "Export to Google Docs"
3. Wait a few seconds (longer for businesses with many entries)
4. A link to your new Google Doc appears

**What's included:**
- Cover page with business name, category, status
- Contact list with roles and details
- All correspondence entries in chronological order
- Page break between each entry
- Entry format: Subject, date/type/contact, formatted text

**What's not included:**
- Original unformatted text (only the clean formatted version)
- Deleted entries
- Draft entries (if applicable in future versions)

**Where does it go:**
The Google Doc is created in your Google Drive, in the same folder as the document (or root if no folder specified).

**Tip:**
You can share, print, or further edit the Google Doc as needed. It's yours.

### Managing Contacts and Businesses

**Viewing contacts for a business:**
1. Open any business letter file
2. Scroll to the "Contacts" section
3. See all recorded contacts with roles, emails, phones

**Adding a new contact:**
- From the New Entry page: Click "Add New Contact" when selecting
- From the Business page: Click "Add Contact" in the Contacts section

**Editing contact details:**
- Click the edit icon next to any contact
- Update name, role, email, phone
- Changes apply immediately

**Why contact details matter:**
When you file correspondence, seeing role and contact details helps you:
- Confirm you're selecting the right person
- Update info as you learn it (promotions, new emails, etc.)
- Keep your letter file clear about who is who

**Adding a new business:**
- From the New Entry page: Click "Add New Business" when selecting
- From the Dashboard: Use the "New Business" button (if available)
- From import: Bulk import businesses from CSV (admin feature)

**Editing business details:**
- Open the business letter file
- Click "Edit Business" (if available)
- Update name, category, status, flags

### Team Collaboration

**Who sees what:**
In Correspondence Clerk, everyone in your organization sees all businesses and correspondence. This ensures team visibility and prevents duplicated effort.

**When you file an entry:**
- It's attributed to you (your name appears on the entry)
- But everyone can see it, search it, and export it
- This is by design - shared knowledge is the goal

**Inviting team members:**
1. Go to Settings > Organization
2. Enter their email address
3. They receive an invitation link
4. Once accepted, they're part of your team

**Revoking access:**
(Future feature - currently all team members have equal access)

## Understanding Your Data

### What Gets Saved When You Create an Entry

Every correspondence entry stores multiple versions:

1. **raw_text_original** - Your exact input, never modified
2. **formatted_text_original** - AI-formatted version when first saved
3. **formatted_text_current** - The version displayed (can be manually edited)

**Why three versions?**
- Safety net: Your original text is always preserved
- Clarity: Formatted text is easier to read and print
- Flexibility: You can manually correct errors without losing history

**Other saved data:**
- Entry date (auto-detected or manually set)
- Subject line (guessed from content)
- Entry type (Email, Call, Meeting)
- Business and contact links
- Who created it and when
- Action needed flag and due date
- AI processing metadata (for troubleshooting)

### How the App Preserves Your Original Text

**Hard rule: Your words are never rewritten.**

When AI formats your text, it only:
- Improves spacing and line breaks
- Formats bullet points and numbered lists
- Makes headers more readable
- Cleans up email artifacts (like quoted text markers)

What it doesn't do:
- Change your wording or tone
- Summarize or shorten
- Add suggestions or next steps
- Invent content

**You can always access the original:**
Every entry keeps `raw_text_original` intact forever. If you ever need to see what you originally pasted, it's there.

### Where Backups Are Stored

Your data is stored in a Supabase PostgreSQL database. Supabase handles:
- Daily automated backups
- Point-in-time recovery (ask your administrator)
- Encrypted storage
- Geographic redundancy

**What this means for you:**
- Your data is safe from accidental deletion
- Catastrophic failures are recoverable
- You don't need to manually back up

**Exporting for local backup:**
You can export any business to Google Docs, which creates a separate copy in your Google Drive.

### Data Structure Explained Simply

Think of your data like a filing cabinet:

**Filing Cabinet = Your Organization**
- Shared by your whole team

**Drawer = Businesses**
- Each business has its own drawer
- Contains all correspondence with that business

**Folders = Contacts**
- People at each business
- Every piece of correspondence is filed under a person

**Pages = Correspondence Entries**
- Individual emails, call notes, meeting notes
- In chronological order
- Each "page" includes the date, type, and person involved

**Connections:**
- Contacts belong to a business (you can't have a "floating" contact)
- Correspondence always links to both a business and a specific contact
- If you delete a business, all its contacts and correspondence are deleted (with confirmation)

<!-- AUTO: database-schema -->

### How Your Data is Stored

**Businesses**

Stores every company or organization you track. Each business has:
- **Name** and basic details
- **Category** - the type of business (e.g., Club Card, Advertiser)
- **Status flags** - Club Card (member) and Advertiser flags
- **Last contacted date** - automatically updated when you file correspondence
- **Contract information** - for members and advertisers

**Contacts**

The people at each business. Each contact has:
- **Name** (required - you must always name a real person)
- **Role or job title** - their position at the business
- **Email address** - primary contact email
- **Phone number** - contact phone
- **Linked to their business** - contacts always belong to a specific business

**Correspondence**

Your filed emails, calls, and meeting notes. Each entry stores:
- **Original text** (raw_text_original) - never changes, your safety net
- **Formatted text** (formatted_text_original) - AI-improved layout when first saved
- **Current text** (formatted_text_current) - the version shown, can be manually edited
- **Date, type, contact, business links** - all the metadata
- **Who saved it and when** - tracks which team member created the entry
- **Action needed status** - none, prospect, follow-up, waiting on them, invoice, renewal
- **Due date** - optional reminder date for follow-ups

**Organizations and Team Members**

How teams share data:
- **Organizations** - your company/team workspace
- **User Profiles** - each team member's account, linked to an organization
- **Invitations** - pending invites sent to team members
- **Shared visibility** - everyone in your organization sees all businesses and correspondence

**Data Safety**

Your data is protected through:
- **Original text preservation** - we never modify raw_text_original
- **Edit tracking** - every edit is timestamped and attributed
- **Foreign key constraints** - prevents orphaned data
- **Automatic backups** - Supabase handles daily backups
- **Row Level Security** - database enforces access permissions

## Common Questions (FAQ)

### Why can't I save without selecting a contact?

This is by design. Correspondence Clerk requires you to name a specific person for every entry because:
- It keeps your letter file clear about who said what
- It prevents vague "someone from XYZ Corp" entries
- It builds a useful contact database over time

If you genuinely don't know the person's name:
- Ask them (in the case of a call)
- Check the email headers (for emails)
- Create a contact like "Sarah [Last Name Unknown]" if necessary

The app won't accept placeholder contacts like "Unknown" or "TBD" - you must name a real person.

### What happens if AI formatting fails?

You can still save your correspondence. Here's what happens:

1. You paste or type your content
2. The app tries to format it with AI
3. If the AI is unavailable (network issue, API outage, etc.):
   - Your entry saves as "unformatted"
   - A "Format later" button appears on the entry
4. When the AI service is back, click "Format later" to retry

**Why this matters:**
AI outages never block you from filing correspondence. Your work continues uninterrupted.

### Can I undo a delete?

Currently, deletes are permanent. Before you delete:
- A confirmation dialog appears
- You must explicitly confirm

**To prevent accidental deletes:**
- Read the confirmation message carefully
- Consider archiving instead of deleting (future feature)

**If you accidentally delete:**
- Contact your administrator
- They can restore from a backup (recent deletes are recoverable)

### What if I paste an email thread?

Correspondence Clerk detects email chains and offers to split them into individual entries.

**The split toggle:**
- Appears when a thread is detected
- Shows a preview of how many entries will be created
- Defaults to ON only when confidence is high
- You must confirm before splitting happens

**If the detection is wrong:**
- Toggle it OFF to keep as one entry
- Or manually split by pasting each email separately

**What if I want to split later?**
You can't automatically split an existing entry. Instead:
- Edit the entry to remove parts
- Create new entries for the removed parts

### Where do my exports go?

Google Doc exports are created in your Google Drive. Specifically:
- In the same folder as the document (if the app has folder context)
- Otherwise, in your Drive root

**After export:**
- You receive a shareable link
- The document is yours to edit, share, or print
- It's not connected back to Correspondence Clerk (it's a snapshot)

### How often is data backed up?

Supabase handles daily automated backups of your database. Additionally:
- Point-in-time recovery allows restoring to any moment
- Your administrator can request a restore if needed

**You can also:**
- Export businesses to Google Docs for your own local backups
- (Future) Full database export for comprehensive backup

### Can I edit entries after saving?

Yes, but only the formatted text. Here's how it works:

**What you can edit:**
- `formatted_text_current` - the displayed version

**What you can't edit:**
- `raw_text_original` - permanently preserved
- `formatted_text_original` - permanently preserved

**How to edit:**
1. Open the entry
2. Click "Edit"
3. Make your changes
4. Save

**What happens when you edit:**
- `edited_at` timestamp is updated
- `edited_by` records your user ID
- A small "edited" indicator appears on the entry
- Original versions remain intact

**Why it's designed this way:**
Edits are for corrections (typos, clarifications), not for rewriting history. You always have the original text as proof of what was actually said.

### What if Outlook integration isn't working?

Correspondence Clerk has a bookmarklet tool that imports emails directly from Outlook Web with one click.

**To install the Email Import Tool:**
1. Go to Settings > Tools (or visit /bookmarklet directly)
2. Drag the bookmarklet button to your bookmarks bar
3. When viewing an email in Outlook Web, click the bookmarklet
4. Correspondence Clerk opens with the email pre-filled

**Manual alternative (any email client):**
1. Open the email in Outlook (or any email client)
2. Select all (Ctrl+A) and copy (Ctrl+C)
3. Paste into Correspondence Clerk's New Entry page
4. File as usual

### What if contact details are missing?

If a contact is missing role, email, or phone:
- When you select them during filing, you'll see the missing fields
- Click "Edit contact details" to add them inline
- You don't have to navigate away - stay in the flow

**Why add details:**
- Makes it easier to reach them later
- Ensures exports include complete contact information
- Helps teammates know who is who

## Troubleshooting

### "AI Formatting Failed" - What to Do

**What happened:**
The AI formatting service (Anthropic API) couldn't process your entry. This could be due to:
- Network connectivity issues
- API service outage
- Rate limiting (too many requests)

**What to do:**
1. Your entry is saved as "unformatted" - nothing is lost
2. A "Format later" button appears on the entry
3. Wait a few minutes and click "Format later"
4. If it still fails, contact your administrator

**Workaround:**
You can manually edit the entry to improve formatting:
1. Click "Edit" on the unformatted entry
2. Add line breaks, clean up spacing, format lists
3. Save your manual edits

**Your data is safe:**
Even if AI formatting permanently fails, you have the original text saved.

### "Duplicate Entry Detected" - Your Options

**What happened:**
Correspondence Clerk noticed you're trying to save an entry that looks very similar to one you recently filed.

**Your options:**
1. **Save anyway** - if this is legitimately a new entry (e.g., follow-up with similar wording)
2. **View existing entry** - to confirm it's already filed
3. **Cancel** - to avoid the duplicate

**Why this check exists:**
Prevents accidental double-filing (e.g., pasting the same email twice).

### Email Thread Split Didn't Work

**What went wrong:**
The thread detection may have:
- Missed some emails in the chain
- Split incorrectly
- Not detected a thread at all

**What to do:**
1. **If split incorrectly:** Delete the incorrect entries and refile manually
2. **If not detected:** Manually split by pasting each email separately
3. **If some emails missed:** Add them as separate entries

**Why it happens:**
Email threads have many formats (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.). The detection is smart but not perfect.

**Tip:**
For important threads, review the preview before confirming the split.

### Can't Save Entry (Missing Required Fields)

**Required fields:**
- Business (must select)
- Contact (must select)
- Content (must have text)

**If you can't save:**
1. Check that you've selected a business
2. Check that you've selected a contact
3. Ensure there's text in the entry field

**If you're missing a contact:**
- Click "Add New Contact" to create one
- You must name a real person (no placeholders)

### Outlook Email Import Tool Not Working

**Check these first:**
- Are you on Outlook Web (outlook.office.com or outlook.live.com)?
- Is an email fully open (not just selected in the list)?
- Did you allow popups for Outlook in your browser?

**Common errors:**

"Please open while viewing an email in Outlook Web"
- The bookmarklet only works on Outlook Web, not the desktop app

"Could not extract email body"
- Make sure the email is fully loaded before clicking the bookmarklet
- Try refreshing the page and clicking again

"Popup blocked"
- Allow popups for Outlook in your browser's address bar

**Reinstall the bookmarklet:**
If nothing works, try reinstalling from Settings > Tools.

**Manual alternative:**
You can always copy-paste manually:
1. Select all (Ctrl+A) and copy (Ctrl+C)
2. Paste into Correspondence Clerk's New Entry page

### Contact Details Missing

**If a contact is missing role, email, or phone:**
1. Find the contact in the business letter file's Contacts section
2. Click "Edit" next to the contact
3. Add the missing details
4. Save

**Or add them during filing:**
- When selecting a contact in New Entry
- If details are missing, an "Add details" option appears
- Add inline without leaving the page

## For Team Administrators

### Inviting Team Members

**To invite someone:**
1. Go to Settings > Organization
2. Click "Invite Team Member"
3. Enter their email address
4. They receive an invitation link via email
5. They click the link, create their account, and join your organization

**What they see after joining:**
- All businesses you've created
- All correspondence filed by anyone on the team
- They can immediately start filing new entries

**Managing invitations:**
- View pending invitations in Settings > Organization
- Resend if needed
- Revoke if someone shouldn't join

### Managing Organization Settings

**Organization details:**
- Name - your company or team name
- Settings - (future) customization options

**Team member list:**
- View all active team members
- See who's invited but hasn't accepted yet
- (Future) Remove team members

### What Everyone Can See (Shared Visibility)

**Current permissions (v1):**
- Everyone in your organization sees all businesses
- Everyone sees all correspondence
- Everyone can file, edit, search, and export

**Why it's designed this way:**
Correspondence Clerk is built for team transparency. Shared visibility prevents:
- Duplicated effort (two people following up with the same business)
- Lost context (someone leaves, their correspondence is still accessible)
- Siloed knowledge (everyone benefits from the letter file)

**Future versions:**
- Per-business access controls
- Read-only users
- Audit trail for edits

<!-- AUTO: hard-rules -->

### Why the App Works This Way

**You must always name a contact**
The app requires you to select (or create) a specific person for every entry. This ensures your letter file is always clear about who you spoke with. No "Unknown" or placeholder contacts allowed.

**Your original wording is never changed**
When AI formats your text, it only improves layout and spacing. Your actual words are preserved exactly as you wrote them in the `raw_text_original` field, which is never modified.

**Contact details are always visible**
When you select a contact, you can immediately see their role, email, and phone. If details are missing, you can add them inline without leaving the filing flow.

**AI failure never blocks you**
If the AI formatting service is unavailable, you can still save your correspondence. It's marked as "unformatted" and you can format it later when the service is back.

**Edits are corrections, not rewrites**
When you edit an entry, you're making manual corrections. The AI never rewrites your content. We preserve both the original formatted version and your edited version.

**No automatic suggestions**
This is a filing system, not a CRM. We don't suggest next steps, auto-follow-ups, or reminders you didn't create. We record what happened.

**Clear, labeled actions**
Every button and action is clearly labeled. No icon-only buttons that leave you guessing.

**Thread splitting is optional**
When you paste an email chain, we detect it and offer to split it into individual entries. But you always get to confirm before we do it.

**Full text search is fast**
We use PostgreSQL's full-text search with GIN indexes, so searching through thousands of entries is near-instant.

**Exports are print-ready**
Google Docs exports use proper formatting with page breaks, so you can print or share them immediately.

### Technical Configuration (For Administrators)

These settings are configured during initial setup:

**NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL**
Where your database is hosted. Set by your administrator during installation. This is the URL of your Supabase project.

**NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY**
Public key for database access. Safe to expose in browser, as it's protected by Row Level Security policies.

**SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY**
Admin key for server-side operations. Never expose to the client. Used for operations that bypass RLS.

**ANTHROPIC_API_KEY**
Enables AI formatting. If this stops working, entries save as "unformatted" until fixed. You can still file correspondence without AI.

**NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL**
The web address where Correspondence Clerk is accessed (e.g., https://correspondence-clerk.vercel.app).

**GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET**
Required for Google Docs export feature. Get these from Google Cloud Console.

**What happens if a key stops working?**
- If Anthropic API fails: Correspondence saves as "unformatted" - you can format it later
- If Supabase fails: App won't load - contact your administrator
- If Google API fails: Export feature won't work, but filing correspondence continues normally
